This sh*t was harder than it should have been.

CustomGreenScreen.py has a function to remove the green from your image, make it transparent, and pixelate it.

globwork.py Will take every image in images/unconv, run them through the green screen filter, place new images in images/conv, animate said new images, and save file as a gif in images/gifs.

Adjust RGB values in CustomGreenScreen.py as necessarry to achieve the best green removal for your image.
